    <h1><i>The Book of Henry</i></h1>
    <p>
        <b>The Book of Henry</b> is a 2017 American drama thriller film directed by Colin Trevorrow and written by Gregg Hurwitz. The film stars Naomi Watts, Jaeden Martell (then known as Jaeden Lieberher), Jacob Tremblay, Sarah Silverman, Lee Pace, Maddie Ziegler, and Dean Norris.[4][5] The story concerns a plan hatched by a young genius, dying of cancer, to save the girl next door from abuse.

The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 14, 2017. It was released in theaters by Focus Features on June 16, 2017, was unsuccessful at the box office, and received generally negative reviews from critics, who cited the screenplay's jarring plot twists and tonal shifts, and Trevorrow's direction, although the cast and the film's ambition received some praise.
